Please provide some information about your script:
 - Where should it run (On-Prem, Azure, Windows, Linux, Full / Desktop)?
 - Which Version are you running (make sure to use the latest)
 - What is your level of PowerShell expertise?

Also please be aware that I'll not help if the following does not apply:
 - DO use GIST (gist.github.com) for full script
 - DO use Markdown formatting for snippets and errors
 - DO NOT throw walls of text in the issues, which'll make me scan for hours.
 - DO read and understand the samples. Please do not use them as is - it's called samples for a reason.
